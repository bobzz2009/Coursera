Description: This program calculates the above statistics from a data set of character elements
 *				It makes use of the following functions:-
 *				
 *				print_array():
 *							This outputs the array on the screen
 *						Parameters:
 *							unsigned char * b: Pointer to the data set
 *							unsigned int n: Number of items in the data set
 *						Return:
 *							Prints out the array
 *
 *				print_statistics():
 *							This prints the overall statistics to the screen.This includes mean,median,maximum and minimum values
 *						-Return:
 *							Prints out the statistics
 *
 *				sort_array():
 *							This re arranges the character data set from smallest to the largest element
 *						Parameters:
 *							unsigned char * s : Pointer to the data set
 *							unsigned int n : Number of elements in the data set
 *						Return:
 *							This prints out the array in order from smallest element to largest element  
 *				
 *				find_mean():
 *							This calculates the mean of the data set
 *						Parameters:
 *							unsigned char * min : Pointer to the data set
 *							unsigned int x : Number of elements in the data set
 *						Return:
 *							This prints out the mean of the data set
 *				
 *				find_median():
 *							This calculates the median of the sorted data set
 *						Parameters:
 *							unsigned char * med : Pointer to the data set
 *							unsigned int num : Number of elements in the data set
 *						Return:
 *							This prints out the median of the data set
 *
 *				find_maximum():
 *							This calculates the largest element in the data set
 *						Parameters:
 *							unsigned char * max: Pointer to the data set
 *							unsigned int n : Number of elements in the data set
 *						Return:
 *							This prints out the largest element in the data set
 *
 *				find_minimum():
 *							This calculates the smallest element in the data set
 *						Parameters:
 *							unsigned char * min: Pointer to the data set
 *							unsigned int n : Number of elements in the data set
 *						Return:
 *							This prints out the smallest element in the data set
